// The scene half, upstream's renderPlayerOverlay minus the friend/clan-rank icons (no sprites, no
// lists), plus the hull/tile styles NPC Indicators has (a kewl extension -- see the config header;
// this plugin replaced the box the worked example kewl.plugins.PlayerVisuals drew).
//
// Everything here is positioned off the ACTOR, never off a widget: the hull is the prism at the
// player's own ground height (Actor.getConvexHull), the tile is the square under its rendered
// position at that same height (Actor.getCanvasTilePoly), the name is the feet point raised along the
// height axis. Widget positions are the one part of the shim that is still unverified, and no scene
// overlay depends on them.
//
// Text sits at getLogicalHeight()+40 above the feet (ABOVE_HEAD) or at half the logical height
// (centre/right) -- and the logical height is the shim's tuning constant (Actor.logicalHeight), so
// the centre/right positions are approximate until it has been measured live.
