// animation, orientation, name. What is approximated, and says so in its javadoc: the convex-hull
// fallback (the validated NPC model path can now replace it; unsupported/player paths fall back), the
// logical height (a tuning constant), the plane (the local player's -- no per-entity plane is exported
// by nEntities). What is an honest default: combat level
// 0, no interacting target, no health bar, no overhead text, no graphic.
