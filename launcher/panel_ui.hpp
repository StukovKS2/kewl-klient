// panel_ui.hpp -- the ImGui side panel the LAUNCHER draws, over the format-2 bridge model.
//
// In launcher mode the strip on the right of the launcher window is this file's job: the launcher
// process has no OpenGL and no Java, so the panel is Dear ImGui rasterized by the CPU
// (client/imgui_sw.hpp) into the window's DIB. The DATA, though, still lives in the game process --
// Java owns the plugin list, the Setting objects, the profiles and the hub, so everything drawn here
// comes from the shared-memory bridge (client/bridge.hpp, parsed in launcher/main.cpp) and every
// mutation goes back as an edit record. Edits MUST land in Java through the DLL (see kewl/panel/
// PanelBridge): an edit that went around Setting.set would silently do nothing to the plugin.
//
// The layout is RuneLite's sidebar in shape -- a 250px body plus a 36px icon rail, four routes
// (plugins, profiles, hub, debug), a plugin list, a pushed config view per plugin -- but the
// TREATMENT is the design pass described below rather than a Java2D transcription.
//
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE DESIGN PASS (2026-09-06). Six rules, and what each one cost or bought here:
//
//  1. TOKENS. Every spacing, size, radius, duration and colour below is a named constant on a 4px
//     base with a reason attached. No LAYOUT value is written inline: a position, a gap, a size or a
//     colour in the drawing code is a token, or arithmetic on tokens, or 0.5f for a centre and 1.0f
//     for a hairline. This is the "you can defend every value" rule.
//     THE ONE EXCEPTION, stated so it does not rot into an excuse: the interior path coordinates of
//     the icon glyphs (pencilGlyph, copyGlyph, crossGlyph, resetGlyph, chevronGlyph, gearWidget,
//     starWidget, tabIcon) are literals like 9.5f and 1.4f. Those are vector artwork inside an
//     ICON_GLYPH-sized cell, not layout -- the cell's ORIGIN and SIZE are tokens, and where the
//     pencil's nib sits inside it is a drawing, the same way a .svg's path data is not a design
//     system. The exception is PATH COORDINATES ONLY: the spinner's rotation rate and sweep are
//     timing and shape rather than a path, so they are tokens (SPIN_*), not literals.
//
//  2. RESPONSE ON POINTER-DOWN. ImGui::Button() fires on RELEASE and only shades on release; that
//     reads as lag on a 30fps software-rasterised strip. Every control here is an InvisibleButton
//     read through IsItemActive() (pressed look, this frame) and IsItemClicked() (which in ImGui is
//     the PRESS edge, not the release edge). pressButton() replaces ImGui::Button everywhere.
//
//  3. MOTION IS A SPRING, NOT A TWEEN. springTo() integrates a damped spring against io.DeltaTime
//     FROM THE CURRENT ON-SCREEN VALUE, so an interrupted animation redirects instead of restarting.
//     Two parameters, damping ratio and response, and one default: critically damped (1.0). Nothing
//     in this panel is reached by a momentum gesture, so nothing bounces. Input is never locked
//     during a transition -- items are submitted at the animated position, so what you see is what
//     you can click.
//
//  4. MATERIAL ENCODES HIERARCHY, AND THE RASTERISER GETS A VOTE. The rail is the heaviest plane,
//     the body sits on it, rows sit on the body, and a pressed row rises LIGHTER rather than sinking
//     darker. Hard 1px dividers are gone: the body/rail seam is carried by the material step, and
//     the list's edges against the fixed header and footer are scroll-edge fades.
//     THE CONSTRAINT: imgui_sw's fast fill path (detail::matchQuad -> fillQuad, a straight row loop)
//     is only taken for an INTEGER-ALIGNED, UNROUNDED, CONSTANT-COLOUR rect. A rounded rect is one
//     convex polygon, so every pixel of it goes through the barycentric path instead. Thirty rounded
//     230x24 row fills is ~165k px/frame down the slow path; the spike measured ~11.5ms for ~229k px
//     that way. So: full-width fills are square and snapped (RADIUS_ROW == 0), rounding is spent
//     only on small controls, and even the animated offsets are snapped to whole pixels so the fast
//     path survives a transition.
//
//  5. TYPE HAS ONE SIZE, SO HIERARCHY COMES FROM ELSEWHERE. The atlas is AddFontDefaultBitmap at
//     13px -- a bitmap face, sampled NEAREST by imgui_sw (sampleTexture), and "recommended at 13px
//     with no scaling". Scaling it would smear the stems, so there is no size axis and no italic.
//     What is left, and what this file uses deliberately: WEIGHT (textAt's bold double-strike at
//     exactly +1px), COLOUR (a three-step text ramp), LEADING (LEAD_*), and TRACKING (textTracked,
//     integral only -- a fractional advance would move a glyph quad off the texel grid and the
//     nearest sample would drop a column). Every text position is snapped for the same reason.
//
//  6. WAYFINDING. Two fixed lines of chrome at the top answer "where am I" (route name, or the
//     plugin's name) and "how do I get out" (a back control that names its destination and never
//     scrolls away), and one fixed line at the bottom answers "is this thing connected".
//
// KNOWN GAPS, on purpose rather than faked:
//   * plugin tags are not searchable: the model region carries name/desc/status and no tag list, so
//     the filter runs over what the bridge actually sends;
//   * colour settings render read-only: the contract has no colour edit kind (kinds 0..3 are
//     bool/int/enum/text), so there is nothing to send. TEXT settings are NOT read-only -- they are
//     edited in place through textInput()'s keyboard handoff, which exists precisely to give the
//     strip a keyboard, with secrets masked in a password field. Their one limit is the bridge's
//     63-byte valueText field, which the field itself enforces (see SET_TEXT in settingRow);
//   * sections render in first-appearance order -- the bridge model does not carry RlConfigMeta's
//     section positions, which is what the Java ConfigView sorts by;
//   * a reset echo cannot show the default value: Setting's default lives Java-side, so the row keeps
//     its old value until the next publish carries the reset one back;
//   * "Reduced motion" is persisted by launcher/main.cpp, not here: uiReducedMotion() is a plain
//     accessor precisely so main.cpp's loadPaths/persistCollapse can mirror it to the ini's
//     [kewl] motion= key, the same way it mirrors uiCollapsed() to sidebar=. This file owns no file
//     I/O and no ini path, so the switch is the state and main.cpp is the storage.
